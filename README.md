# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to generate a data list cities and hotels around the world using Google Maps Directions API that the vacation
preferences of PlanMyTrip app vacation goers. Beta testers input temperature ranges to filter the API generated data to find travel destinations 
and nearby hotels that fit their preferences. Testers will then choose 4 cities and we created a travel itinerary for them using the gmaps plugin.
